  description: 'Have you ever been wondering whose [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801400247]Mod
    Selector[/url] profile let that module appear on the bomb, or just want to know
    which of your experts can help you with it? This mod will give you the answers
    without leaving the game.


    Highlight (but do not select) any module for a few seconds, or press F1 while
    it is highlighted or selected, and the mod will show the following:

    * All active expert profiles which enable the module

    * All active expert profiles which disable the module

    * All inactive defuser profiles which would veto the module


    The key mentioned above and the delay before the overlay appears can be configured.
    There is also an option to show the module''s name, but using this will disable
    submitting leaderboard entries.


    This mod is currently not compatible with motion controls in VR.
